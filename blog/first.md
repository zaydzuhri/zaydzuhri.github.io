# blogging?

idk some say that blogging is a good thing, but I feel like I just need to get out of the shackles of twitter formerly X and its character limit. Also there's some stuff I want to archive properly and put out on the internet, instead of being lost in the media tab of a mid X profile. Hopefully I can keep this up, but we'll see how it goes. Ideally I'll also put up experiment logs here, but I feel like if I do get a big result I'll just end up going back to X and posting it there. 

Not a big writing guy, I mainly just like to think inside my head. If something is written, it's usually just to either do some big boy shape-rotating or just to keep myself accountable. On X, there's likes and engagement. Here, there's just me. I guess that's the point. Let's see how far this goes.
